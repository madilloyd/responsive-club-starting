Project for codecademy (start:9/8/24)

WEB DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATIONS

Overview:
​This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which 
describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources 
when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.​

Project Goals:
In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​

Setup Instructions:
If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. If you need help setting up your computer, read 
our article about setting up a text editor for HTML/CSS development.

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate:​
 - Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size.
 - Using a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
 - Employing responsive units em and rem to size and space elements with width and padding.
